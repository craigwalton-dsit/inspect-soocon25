In case you have problems downloading a local model or running an eval against it, here
are some completed eval logs which you can view with the Inspect AI VS Code extension or
`inspect view` (make sure you've activated the virtual environment and installed the
dependencies):

```sh
inspect view --log-dir sample-logs
```

Then copy and paste the URL into your browser.
