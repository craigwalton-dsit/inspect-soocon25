# Workshop Presenter Notes

There are a couple of steps which will take a few minutes to complete so we'll get
started right away and while we're waiting for them to complete, I'll tell you a bit
more about Inspect and what it is used for.

## About Inspect

* Inspect is a tool written and open-sourced by the UK's AI Safety Institute (AISI).
  We're part of the UK Government's Department of Science, Innovation and Technology.
* We are conducting research and building infrastructure to test the safety of advanced
  AI and to measure its impacts on people and society.
* We open sourced Inspect (which is not common/popular practice for government) to
  help accelerate the work on AI safety evaluations being carried out across the globe.
* It is used by many other safety research groups as well as some of the frontier model
  developers.

## What kind of evaluations can you run with Inspect?

* Simple question/answer tasks.
* Can also be automatically graded by a model which is given a grading rubric.
* Safeguard evaluations like checking a model will refuse to do something harmful.
* Tool-based or "agentic" tasks where the model is given tools like a terminal or Python
  to solve tasks.
* Cyber-security evaluations like hacking into a web server.
* Loss of control evaluations where a model tries to replicate itself or train a smarter
  version of itself.
